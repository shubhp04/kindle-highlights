Nonexperimental data are not accumulated through controlled experiments on individuals, firms,  or segments of the economy. (Nonexperimental data are sometimes called observational data, or  retrospective data, to emphasize the fact that the researcher is a passive collector of the data.)

Experimental data are often collected in laboratory environments in the natural sciences, but  they are more difficult to obtain in the social sciences. Although some social experiments can be  devised, it is often impossible, prohibitively expensive, or morally repugnant to conduct the kinds  of controlled experiments that would be needed to address economic issues.

A panel data (or longitudinal data) set consists of a time series for each cross-sectional member  in the data set. As an example, suppose we have wage, education, and employment history for a set  of individuals followed over a 10-year period. Or we might collect information, such as investment  and financial data, about the same set of firms over a five-year time period. Panel data can also be  collected on geographical units. For example, we can collect data for the same set of counties in the  United States on immigration flows, tax rates, wage rates, government expenditures, and so on, for  the years 1980, 1985, and 1990.

The notion of ceteris paribus also can be described through counterfactual reasoning, which  has become an organizing theme in analyzing various interventions, such as policy changes. The idea  is to imagine an economic unit, such as an individual or a firm, in two or more different states of the  world. For example, consider studying the impact of a job training program on workers’ earnings.  For each worker in the relevant population, we can imagine what his or her subsequent earnings  would be under two states of the world: having participated in the job training program and having  not participated. By considering these counterfactual outcomes (also called potential outcomes),  we easily “hold other factors fixed” because the counterfactual thought experiment applies to each  individual separately.

Each of these three equations is a type of difference equation. In its most general form, a difference equation expresses the value of a variable as a function of its  own lagged values, time, and other variables. The trend and seasonal terms are both  functions of time and the irregular term is a function of its own lagged value and of  the stochastic variable 𝜀t.

The nth difference (Δn) is defined analogously. At this point, we risk taking the  theory of difference equations too far. As you will see, the need to use second differences rarely arises in time-series analysis. It is safe to say that third- and higher order  differences are never used in applied work.
